# CursorControllerWithElectron

This is a tiny application developed using Electronjs to learn the framework. Although it is commonly used by our team to auto pass a useless and mandatory lecture.

- Used Robotjs to access and manipulate mouse cursor.
- Used jQuery and Vanilla JS + HTML (No Css, yet)
- Used Electron Forge to distribute
